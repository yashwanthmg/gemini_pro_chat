Model Output: Hello, 

  

I am new to FEMM, and I am trying to use it to calculate the magnetic field inside a coil. 

  

For this, I have created a coil by using the rectangle tool and defined a current density for it. 

I have also created a circle to serve as the air domain and defined a boundary condition of "zero magnetic vector potential". 

Finally, I have created a line segment inside the coil to serve as the observation point where I want to calculate the magnetic field. 

  

However, when I try to calculate the magnetic field, I get an error message saying that "the domain is not meshed". Although I have selected the mesh option and clicked on the solve button, the mesh is not generated and the magnetic field cannot be calculated. 

  

Could you please help me with this issue? 

Thank you very much for your help. 

  

I have tried using the "mesh adaption" option, but it doesn't seem to work. The mesh is still not generated, and I still get the same error message. 

  

I have also tried using the "advanced meshing" option, but I am not sure how to use it properly. Could you please provide me with some instructions on how to use this option? 

  

Thank you again for your help. 

  

1. Open FEMM and import the geometry file containing the coil, air domain, and observation point. 

2. Click on the "Mesh" menu and select "Advanced Meshing". 

3. In the "Advanced Meshing" dialog box, select the "Free Mesh" option. 

4. Click on the "Mesh" button to generate the mesh. 

5. Once the mesh is generated, click on the "Solve" button to calculate the magnetic field. 

  

Here are some additional tips for using the "Advanced Meshing" option: 

  

* You can specify the maximum and minimum element size in the "Mesh" dialog box. 

* You can also specify the number of elements in each direction in the "Mesh" dialog box. 

* If you are having trouble generating a mesh, you can try using a different meshing algorithm. To do this, click on the "Mesh" menu and select "Meshing Algorithm". 

* You can also try using the "Mesh Adaptation" option to refine the mesh in areas where the solution is changing rapidly. To do this, click on the "Mesh" menu and select "Mesh Adaptation". 

  

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Model Output: the Ashbury Hospital, he will tell us the method now adopted there for recording and keeping the umbilical cord. I have had experience of several methods and have found this to be the best. Dr. A. E. Giles: The method is as follows: The cord is cut about three-quarters to one inch from the child's abdomen. The umbilical end of the cord is tied tightly round with two ligatures, the first two inches from the umbilicus, the second half an inch farther from the umbilicus. The distal end of the cord is then seized, about an inch beyond the first ligature, with the left hand, and the cord is cut off, leaving one inch of umbilical end of the cord projecting. Four sterilised hair-pins are now slipped over the distal end of the cord, and the umbilicus is rendered sterile by painting it with iodine and applying a hot compress. In about an hour the four pins are separated from one another, and their sharp points are pressed, one by one, into the umbilicus, the direction in which they are pressed being upwards, downwards, to the right, and to the left. These four pins prevent the umbilical end of the cord from falling forward or sinking back, and by holding it in contact with the umbilicus they facilitate the formation of adhesions. After three days the ends of the pins are bent down and the pins are allowed to work out. When the umbilicus is healed the ends of the hair-pins are cut off with scissors. An aseptic burn of the umbilicus is produced by the points of the hair-pins, and infective organisms are destroyed. This method has a particular advantage in being painless. Like Dr. Rogers, I have seen several methods of treating the cord tried, and none has been as satisfactory as this. Dr. W. E. Fothergill: I have nothing to say about the treatment of the umbilical cord, but I should like to ask whether any of the members has seen a real case of infantile syphilis. Infected children do not come under our observation in the maternity hospital; they come to the children's hospital or are treated in the out-patient department. I confess that, except for three or four cases of syphilis in which the symptoms have appeared late, I have never recognised a true case of syphilitic infection in an infant. What we usually call syphilis in infants is really a congenital form of infantile scurvy. Children of syphilitic parents exhibit the conditions known as rachitis and marasmus, and women who habitually give birth to syphilitic children may be said to be rheumatic. They have rheumatic shoulders, they have suffered from rheumatic fever, and they complain of rheumatic pains. In many cases the husbands of syphilitic women have had no venereal disease, and in a certain number of cases the syphilitic women deny ever having had venereal disease. There are, however, certain families known to be syphilitic, the members of which are constantly being treated for it. The mothers in these families are known to have been infected. In dealing with syphilitic women the question as to whether they should be treated with mercury is a very important one. Pregnancy occurs, as in the case Dr. Rogers has mentioned, in syphilitic women who have taken insufficient mercury, or in women who have taken no mercury. Should these women take mercury during pregnancy in the hope of preventing the possibility of the child's being born syphilitic? In rare instances children of syphilitic parents have been born apparently healthy and have remained healthy, even though the mothers have not taken mercury during pregnancy. On the other hand, I have seen children born apparently healthy from syphilitic mothers who have taken mercury during pregnancy or who have been treated for syphilis, and the children have shown symptoms of syphilis a few days or weeks later. These observations show the uncertainty of the results of treating syphilitic women during pregnancy. In one case mercury caused toxic symptoms in the mother and did not prevent the birth of a syphilitic child. I think the general opinion is that mercury taken by the mother during pregnancy is not of any moment, although it may produce toxic symptoms in the mother. On the other hand, we know that children of syphilitic parents are often born healthy, and remain so if they are properly fed. It is said that 80 per cent of the children of syphilitic parents are born apparently healthy and remain so. Practically, therefore, we have to deal with two classes of cases. 1. Women with syphilis who have been insufficiently treated. 2. Women who have never had syphilis, but in whom the child's syphilis is congenital and, in a certain sense, quiescent. With regard to the first class, I think it is best to treat the mother during pregnancy with mercury, either by injections or by inunction, in order to prevent possible miscarriage or the birth of a syphilitic child. With regard to the second class, which includes the children, I do not think it is necessary to treat the children. The majority of them remain healthy if they are properly fed. Of course, a child who is badly fed either by breast or bottle will become rachitic or marasmic, and is almost sure to be called syphilitic. Dr. W. E. Fothergill: What is the name of the old woman at London Bridge? Dr. A. E. Giles: Mrs. Keymer, of 155, Tooley Street. Dr. W. E. Fothergill: Yes, that is the woman. It is a curious fact that she has been able to acquire a certain amount of information about uterine hæmorrhage and other diseases met with in pregnancy. She has attended many women during their confinements, and has even been called to cases of puerperal fever. Dr. Stanley Boyd: I have seen a few cases of definite infantile syphilis in which the symptoms were present at birth or soon after, but I do not think I have ever seen a case of congenital syphilis that has been contracted in utero. The condition which has been referred to as infantile syphilis is really congenital scurvy, the signs and symptoms of which are identical with those of syphilis. In the former there is at first a dry syphilitic rash, and in the latter a scurvy rash which later becomes a syphilitic rash. The diagnosis can only be made by examination of the blood. This should be done in every case, and if the blood shows altered red corpuscles, ectoparasites, and myelocytes in fair numbers, scurvy, not syphilis, is present. Dr. Donald: The woman at London Bridge is a very intelligent person, but she has had no proper training, and this accounts for certain errors in her diagnoses. Her treatment of puerperal fever has been very successful. It is simply the application of antiseptics, such as carbolic acid, creolin, &c., and it has often been attended with good results. Dr. R. H. Bell: I have had under my care quite a number of syphilitic babies, and although it is sometimes difficult to diagnose them, they can be distinguished from children suffering from scurvy. I have found it difficult in cases in which the mother has had active syphilis during pregnancy to prevent the child from showing definite symptoms of it shortly after birth. In such cases it is necessary to treat the mother during pregnancy in order to prevent infection of the fœtus in utero. Since I became attached to the Royal Maternity Charity I have never treated a syphilitic mother during pregnancy with mercury, and I have not seen a single case of syphilitic infection in the fœtus, although the mothers have been syphilitic. This points to the conclusion that it is not necessary to treat syphilitic mothers during pregnancy with mercury. Mercury taken by the mother during pregnancy may prevent the child from becoming syphilitic, but it does not always do so. Dr. Donald: With regard to the treatment of the umbilical cord, I think it is better to tie the cord with a broad, flat ligature than with string. A broad ligature causes less constriction of the vessels, and it is less likely to give rise to hæmorrhage after the separation of the cord. Dr. A. E. Giles: I agree that a flat ligature is better than a round one, but we must not forget that the ligature is a foreign body, and that it may cause septic infection. That is the reason why in the method which I have described hair-pins are used to keep the umbilical end of the cord in apposition with the umbilicus and to promote the formation of adhesions. Dr. W. E. Fothergill: Would you care to try the method of treatment practised at the Liverpool Lying-in Hospital? Dr. A. E. Giles: Yes; I should be glad to try it. Dr. W. E. Fothergill: After the ligature has been applied, the umbilical end of the cord is fastened to the umbilicus with a single stitch of sterilised catgut. In this way all danger from the presence of a foreign body is removed. Aseptic suppuration, with the formation of a scab, takes place, and the cord drops off in the usual way. Mr. W. H. Evans: I have seen cases of syphilis in infants in which the symptoms appeared at birth. I think it is important to treat syphilitic mothers during pregnancy with mercury, so as to prevent the possibility of the children showing symptoms of the disease after birth. Dr. W. E. Fothergill: I am glad to hear that Mr. Evans thinks it necessary to treat syphilitic mothers during pregnancy with mercury. In many of these cases the father as well as the mother has syphilis, and he also should be treated. A CASE OF ACUTE URETHRITIS IN EARLY INFANCY. BY DONALD ARMSTRONG, M.D. (Edin.), OBSTET. TUTOR

Model Output: I have no idea why this is happening, but the game has started crashing to desktop every other time I try to play it. This has happened four times in a row now and it crashes 90%+ of the time when I try to load a save file, except for once when it crashed at the main menu. I've tried looking up a solution but nothing I've found has helped, so I'm wondering if there's something obvious I'm missing. 

  

I'm using a few mods, but they're the same ones I've been using since I started the game and I've never had this issue before. The mods are: 

  

* SPEAR - Stability, Performance, and Reliability 

* Radious Total Realism 

* CAMPAIGN CAMERA 

* Unit Info Panel 

* Warhammer 2 End Turn Camera (I have Three Kingdoms installed too, I think this is why I have this) 

* LL Mod Variety 

  

Does anyone know what's causing this?

Model Output: After their impressive performance against L.A. Galaxy, Chivas USA will look to continue their recent good form when they visit Montreal Impact at Saputo Stadium on Saturday. Chivas are unbeaten in their past three games, including a 2-2 draw on the road against their Western Conference rivals San Jose Earthquakes. 

  

They will have a tough task on their hands against Montreal, however, as the home side have lost just once in their last 10 games in all competitions. That loss came against Toronto FC in the Canadian Championship semifinals. 

  

Montreal are currently seventh in the Eastern Conference, but a win on Saturday would move them back into the playoff places. Chivas, meanwhile, are 10th in the West, but a victory would see them close the gap on the teams above them. 

  

Here is all you need to know ahead of Saturday’s game: 

  

<strong>Date:</strong> Saturday, July 29 

  

<strong>Time:</strong> 7:30 p.m. ET 

  

<strong>Venue:</strong> Saputo Stadium, Montreal, Canada 

  

<strong>TV:</strong> MLS Live, Univision Deportes 

  

<strong>Live stream:</strong> MLS Live, Univision Deportes En Vivo 

  

<strong>Preview</strong> 

  

Chivas have been in good form recently, and they will be confident of getting a result against Montreal. The Goats have scored seven goals in their last three games, and they will be looking to continue that scoring form on Saturday. 

  

Montreal, meanwhile, have been struggling for goals in recent weeks. They have scored just once in their last three games, and they will need to find a way to break down the Chivas defense if they want to win on Saturday. 

  

The Impact will be without midfielder Patrice Bernier, who is suspended after being sent off in their last game. Ignacio Piatti is also a doubt for the game, as he is struggling with a hamstring injury. 

  

Chivas will be without defender Carlos Alvarez, who is out with a knee injury. However, they will be boosted by the return of midfielder Oswaldo Minda, who has been out with a hamstring injury. 

  

<strong>Prediction</strong> 

  

This is a tough game to call, as both teams have been in good form recently. However, Chivas have the better attacking players, and they will be confident of getting a result against Montreal. 

  

<strong>Montreal Impact 1-2 Chivas USA</strong>

这就是当1985年9月19日凌晨墨西哥7.2级地震袭击首都墨西哥城时，27岁的詹姆斯·奥尔布赖特博士在墨西哥城威斯汀雷福玛酒店 亲身体验到的情景。奥尔布赖特被困在酒店的电梯里，发现酒店天花板向下坠落，他只能躲在电梯的角落里。在100名电梯维修工人努力救援下，奥尔布赖特最终于地震发生后的36小时获救。 

  

37年来，墨西哥城重现了类似1985年的噩梦。当地时间9月19日13时14分，墨西哥城以西133公里的米却肯州发生7.4级地震，墨西哥城市中心亦有强烈震感。震源深度约20公里。据美国地质调查局消息，地震导致500至800万人有震感。 

  

当天是1985年的同一天，也正值1985年地震37周年纪念之际，墨西哥全国举行了震亡者纪念活动。墨西哥城还举行了地震警报演习。万人参加的纪念仪式仅持续了20-30秒，就被强烈的警报声打断。人们听到警报声后迅速疏散，这是墨西哥刚实施的新地震警报系统。 

  

墨西哥应对自然灾害的警报系统鲜有全球能出其右者，开创了多个第一。世界上第一个专用的海啸警报系统，第一个时刻监听的地震警报系统，这是墨西哥在应对自然灾害方面做出的伟大贡献。 

  

墨西哥位于太平洋和加勒比海的火山地震带上，是全世界地震最多的国家之一。每年约发生小规模地震10000多次。其中，内陆州分与海岸部分别有两次地震活动高峰期，内陆州为4-5月和9-10月，海岸部分为5-7月和10-11月。墨西哥也面临着频繁的海啸和飓风侵袭。2017年发生的两场地震，就造成300多人死亡。墨西哥经历过无数次大大小小的地震海啸。 

  

上世纪80年代，墨西哥举全国之力，制定了一系列防御地震海啸灾害的法律法规，成立了应对自然灾害的专门机构，大力开展地震灾害科普宣传，努力提高公众的抗震防灾意识，取得了明显成效。 

  

墨西哥CT研究所所长路易斯·富恩特斯·萨拉查介绍说，墨西哥是第一个制定“地震灾害准备计划”的国家。墨西哥首都墨西哥城于1985年地震中遭受重创后，墨西哥政府随即开始按照该计划的指导思想，重点致力于采取措施减小该国首都和其他城市地震破坏的风险。从建筑抗震设防标准、建筑物结构安全、到供水、供电、交通等基础设施的抗震要求，再到学校、社区的抗震教育和演练，该计划覆盖全面、措施具体，有着非常强的可操作性。 

  

1991年墨西哥政府通过了《全国公共安全法》，其中包括了针对地震灾害的应急管理内容，明确了政府、社会及个人在应急管理中的职责和分工，规定了应急管理的八项原则，包括：政府应当发挥领导作用，保障公民的生命安全。 

  

1995年发布的《墨西哥国家应急计划》确定了全国应急管理的组织机构、体系和步骤。该计划由四个部分组成，包括对各类自然灾害的风险评估，评估结果总结和应急反应，以及相应人员的培训和教育。 

  

1998年，墨西哥与日本、美国、秘鲁和瑞士等国一起，根据联合国开发计划署提出的“人类发展报告”中关于灾害预防和减灾的建议，共同发布了《世界防灾战略》，旨在减少易受灾害国家和社区的风险和脆弱性。这一战略基于“减灾是可行的”和“减灾对可持续发展是必需的”两项基本原则，并强调了可持续发展、性别平等、社区参与、减灾能力建设四个关键领域。 

  

2000年发布的《国家民防法》取代了早期的《国家民防条例》。该法是新时期墨西哥民防工作的基本准绳，是推进墨西哥民防事业的重要依据，重点加强了以下几方面的规定： 

  

一是要求地方建立自己的民防体系，包括领导决策机构和执行机构，统一管理本地区的民防工作； 

  

二是对各政府部门的职责进行了明确分工，并强调多部门联合协作的重要性； 

  

三是赋予了民防机构行政权力，包括检查、监督等权力，有效保障了《国家民防法》的执行； 

  

四是建立了民防基金，为民防工作提供稳定的资金保障； 

  

五是强化了公民参与的重要性，鼓励公民积极参与民防工作。 

  

2012年发布的《墨西哥国家减灾方案》是墨西哥为实现千年发展目标而采取的国家减灾战略，也是墨西哥2013-2018年减灾工作（包括自然、人祸和混合类型灾害）的路线图。该方案正式提出了从减灾应对为主转向减灾预防为主的战略目标，纳入了适应气候变化的内容，强调了灾害预防、抗灾能力建设和减少灾害风险等方面的重点内容。 

  

2018年发布的《综合风险管理法》是一个具有里程碑意义的法律，它将减灾预防、抗灾能力建设、风险转移和应对灾害纳入统一的管理框架下，其中特别强调了对脆弱人群进行保护。 

  

该法律也是墨西哥政府应对自然灾害的指导性法律，为墨西哥国家综合风险管理系统提供了法律保障，旨在减轻灾害影响、促进恢复重建和发展、加强公民应对灾害的能力。法律还明确了墨西哥总统、内政部长、国家综合风险管理协调员、各联邦部门、各州、各市的责任和权力。 

  

除了国家层面的法律法规，各州、各市也都有各自的法律法规、方案、规程和方法，以此做到了国家层面的法律法规与地方情况的紧密结合。 

  

尤其是针对地震灾害，墨西哥城还制定了专门的法规，即《墨西哥城地震预警法》，要求该市每栋建筑都必须安装地震控制器，这样就能在发生地震地震瞬间迅速发出警报。2012年，墨西哥城投入4个亿，建成了全世界最大的地震预警系统。 

  

据说，这个预警系统是全球首个能够给予人们补救行动时间，避开强震的系统。这一系统最慢能在地震开始后5秒就发出警告，若地震发生在离墨西哥城较远的地方，那么地震预警系统就可在地震波击中首都前1分钟发出警告。 

  

墨西哥城的情况还仅仅是个缩影，墨西哥的地震预警系统也是一个壮观的宏观系统。它由100多个地震监测站、9000多个地震报警器和超过15000个摄像头组成，覆盖全国各地。 

  

当系统检测到地震时，它会自动向收音机、电视和互联网发布警报，并通过公共扬声器和短信向公众发出警告。 

  

墨西哥的地震预警系统被认为是世界上最先进的，并在挽救生命方面发挥了重要作用。它不仅可以为个人和家庭提供预警，而且还可以为应急人员和基础设施运营商提供预警，以便他们采取必要的预防措施或启动应急响应。 

  

在墨西哥，地震预警系统被认为是拯救生命和减少灾害损失的有效工具。墨西哥也是世界上第一个开发出地震预警系统的国家，该系统自1991年以来一直运行。目前，墨西哥持续改进该系统，以确保其能够及时准确地检测地震和发出警报。 

  

地震灾害往往具有突发性和破坏性，墨西哥则举全国之尽全力，建立了独具特色的地震灾害预防和应急响应体系，为地震灾害的有效应对及风险减缓奠定了坚实基础。（作者系上海外国语大学拉丁美洲研究中心讲师）

1893-1942, 画家 

  

<b>船戸 与一</b>（ふなと よいち、1893年7月2日 - 1942年12月24日）は、日本の洋画家。 

  

<h2>来歴</h2> 

  

長野県東筑摩郡本郷村（現・松本市）生まれ。日本美術学校選科卒。 1917年第一次世界大戦で学徒兵に召集される。 除隊後、1918年再入隊し、1919年除隊して帰国。 1925年右目網膜剥離で失明。1927年安井曾太郎と知遇、彼の勧めにより油彩画の制作に取り組む。 1933年ヴェネツィア・ビエンナーレで、油絵『雨』が入賞し、国際的に注目を浴びる。 1935年第8回帝展で『女』が特選受賞した。 1941年再び右目を手術。肺結核に侵され、1942年12月24日に、長野県上伊那郡宮田村（現・駒ヶ根市）の自宅で没した。享年49。 

  

<h2>作風・作品</h2> 

  

初期は風俗画の領域に専念し、『母子』『枕辺』のような、身辺をテーマとする作品が多い。1927年頃から安井曾太郎に油彩画を勧められて試みるようになった。その頃の風景画や静物画（『パンと梨』『果と楽器』）は、表現主義的傾向の強いもの。1929年頃から、モデルを用いた人物像（『女』）が多くみられるようになる。1930年代には、その表現がさらに抽象的・装飾的になり、『雨』『年老いた女優』のような作品が生まれる。この頃には、人間の生きざまを問うような作品も現れ、『寄宿舎の女』『婚約者』『立ち聞きする女』など、人物の精神性を追求する作品を多く残した。

Model Output: Liverpool are reportedly sizing up a move for Sheffield United midfielder Sander Berge. 

  

The Norway international, who has 21 caps for his country, has shown his ability to control games from the middle of the park and has become a key part of the Blades' midfield since joining from Genk in January 2020. 

  

His performances have caught the eye of some of the Premier League's top clubs, with Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur all previously linked with a move for the 24-year-old. 

  

According to TEAMtalk, Liverpool are now leading the race to sign Berge and are willing to pay £35m for his services. 

  

The report claims that the Reds are keen to add more depth to their midfield ahead of the 2023-24 season and see Berge as a player who can provide cover for Jordan Henderson, Thiago Alcantara and Fabinho. 

  

Berge has made 88 appearances for Sheffield United, scoring seven goals and providing one assist. 

  

The midfielder is contracted to the Blades until June 2024, but it is understood that he is open to a move away from Bramall Lane this summer. 

Model Output: <h1>Modern Marxism</h1> 

  

<b>Modern Marxism</b> is a branch of Marxist theory that emerged in the early 20th century, following the death of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. It represents a heterodox body of thought, incorporating diverse perspectives and interpretations of Marxist theory. 

  

One of the key features of modern Marxism is its emphasis on the cultural, social, and political aspects of capitalism. Modern Marxists argue that capitalism is not only an economic system, but also a social and cultural system that shapes the ways in which people think, feel, and act. They focus on the ways in which capitalism produces social inequality, alienation, and exploitation, and on the ways in which it shapes the development of human subjectivity. 

  

Another key feature of modern Marxism is its emphasis on the historical and dynamic nature of capitalism. Modern Marxists argue that capitalism is not a static system, but rather a constantly evolving and changing system. They focus on the ways in which capitalism has changed over time, and on the ways in which it is likely to change in the future. They also focus on the ways in which capitalism interacts with other social and cultural systems, and on the ways in which it is shaped by these systems. 

  

Finally, modern Marxism is characterized by its political engagement. Modern Marxists are committed to using their theoretical insights to promote social and political change. They argue that capitalism is a system that is ultimately unsustainable, and that it must be replaced with a more just and equitable social order. They work to develop strategies for social change, and to build alliances with other social movements that are working for a better world. 

  

Some of the most prominent modern Marxist thinkers include Georg Lukács, Karl Korsch, Antonio Gramsci, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Herbert Marcuse, and Louis Althusser. Modern Marxism has also been influential in the development of other branches of social theory, such as critical theory, feminist theory, and postcolonial theory. 

  

<h2>History</h2> 

  

Modern Marxism emerged in the early 20th century, following the death of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. It was a response to the challenges posed by the rise of capitalism and the failure of the socialist revolutions of the 19th century. Modern Marxists sought to develop a more nuanced understanding of capitalism and to identify new strategies for social and political change. 

  

One of the key figures in the development of modern Marxism was Georg Lukács. Lukács argued that capitalism had created a new form of alienation, which he called "reification". Reification is the process by which social relations are transformed into things, and by which people are reduced to commodities. Lukács argued that reification had a profound impact on the human psyche, leading to a sense of meaninglessness and despair. 

  

Another key figure in the development of modern Marxism was Karl Korsch. Korsch argued that capitalism was a "historical system", which meant that it was constantly changing and evolving. He also argued that capitalism was a "world system", which meant that it was not confined to any one country or region. Korsch's work laid the foundation for a more dynamic and global understanding of capitalism. 

  

Antonio Gramsci was another important figure in the development of modern Marxism. Gramsci argued that capitalism was not only an economic system, but also a cultural and political system. He argued that capitalism was maintained through a process of "hegemony", which is the process by which the ruling class maintains its power by gaining the consent of the working class. Gramsci's work on hegemony has been influential in the development of cultural studies and political theory. 

  

Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse were three members of the Frankfurt School, a group of German Marxist thinkers who were active in the 1930s and 1940s. The Frankfurt School theorists argued that capitalism was a system that was inherently irrational and destructive. They argued that capitalism produced a "culture industry" that served to pacify and control the working class. The Frankfurt School theorists also argued that capitalism was leading to a new form of barbarism. 

  

Louis Althusser was a French Marxist philosopher who was active in the 1960s and 1970s. Althusser argued that Marxism was a "science" that could be used to understand the underlying structures of society. He also argued that capitalism was a "mode of production" that was characterized by the exploitation of the working class. Althusser's work has been influential in the development of structural Marxism. 

  

<h2>Key concepts</h2> 

  

Modern Marxism is a broad and diverse body of thought, but it is possible to identify a number of key concepts that are shared by many modern Marxist thinkers. These concepts include: 

  

* <b>Alienation</b>: Alienation is the process by which people are separated from their own labor, from the products of their labor, and from other people. Alienation is a central concept in Marxist theory, and it is seen as one of the key problems of capitalism. 

* <b>Commodification</b>: Commodification is the process by which things are transformed into commodities. Commodities are things that are produced for sale on the market. Capitalism is a system that is based on the commodification of labor, land, and capital. 

* <b>Contradiction</b>: Contradiction is a key concept in Marxist theory. Contradictions are tensions or conflicts that exist within a system. Marx argued that capitalism is a system that is full of contradictions, and that these contradictions will eventually lead to its downfall. 

* <b>Dialectic</b>: The dialectic is a method of analysis that is used to understand the development of society and history. The dialectic involves identifying the contradictions within a system and then showing how these contradictions lead to the system's transformation. Marx argued that the development of society and history is a dialectical process. 

* <b>Exploitation</b>: Exploitation is the process by which the ruling class extracts surplus value from the working class. Surplus value is the value that is created by the working class over and above the value of their own labor power. Exploitation is a central concept in Marxist theory, and it is seen as one of the key sources of social inequality. 

* <b>Hegemony</b>: Hegemony is the process by which the ruling class maintains its power by gaining the consent of the working class. Hegemony is achieved through a variety of means, including the control of the media, the education system, and the legal system. Hegemony is a key concept in Marxist theory, and it is seen as one of the key reasons why capitalism has been able to survive for so long. 

* <b>Historical materialism</b>: Historical materialism is a theory of history that emphasizes the importance of the economic structure of society. Historical materialists argue that the economic structure of society determines the political, social, and cultural superstructure. Historical materialism is a key concept in Marxist theory, and it is used to explain the development of society and history. 

* <b>Revolution</b>: Revolution is a key concept in Marxist theory. Marxists argue that capitalism is a system that is inherently unstable and that it will eventually be overthrown by a socialist revolution. Revolution is seen as the only way to achieve a just and equitable society. 

  

<h2>Schools of thought</h2> 

  

Modern Marxism is a diverse and heterodox body of thought, and it is possible to identify a number of different schools of thought within modern Marxism. These schools of thought include: 

  

* <b>Western Marxism</b>: Western Marxism is a school of thought that emerged in Europe in the early 20th century. Western Marxists are influenced by a variety of philosophical traditions, including existentialism, phenomenology, and psychoanalysis. Western Marxists tend to emphasize the cultural, social, and political aspects of capitalism. 

* <b>Structural Marxism</b>: Structural Marxism is a school of thought that emerged in France in the 1960s and 1970s. Structural Marxists are influenced by the work of Louis Althusser. Structural Marxists tend to emphasize the economic and political structures of capitalism. 

* <b>Marxist humanism</b>: Marxist humanism is a school of thought that emerged in Yugoslavia in the 1950s and 1960s. Marxist humanists are influenced by the work of Karl Marx, Georg Lukács, and Antonio Gramsci. Marxist humanists tend to emphasize the importance of human freedom and creativity. 

* <b>Dependency theory</b>: Dependency theory is a school of thought that emerged in Latin America in the 1950s and 1960s. Dependency theorists are influenced by the work of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Antonio Gramsci. Dependency theorists tend to emphasize the role of imperialism in the underdevelopment of the Third World. 

* <b>Postcolonial Marxism</b>: Postcolonial Marxism is a school of thought that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s. Postcolonial Marxists are influenced by the work of Karl Marx, Antonio Gramsci, and Frantz Fanon. Postcolonial Marxists tend to emphasize the role of colonialism and imperialism in the development of capitalism. 

  

<h2>Influence</h2> 

  

Modern Marxism has had a profound influence on the development of social theory and political thought. It has also been influential in the development of other fields, such as economics, sociology, and anthropology. 

  

Some of the most prominent modern Marxist thinkers include: 

  

* Georg Lukács 

* Karl Korsch 

* Antonio Gramsci 

* Theodor Adorno 

* Max Horkheimer 

* Herbert Marcuse 

* Louis Althusser 

* Ernesto Laclau 

* Chantal Mouffe 

* Slavoj Žižek 

  

Modern Marxism has also been influential in the development of social movements, such as the anti-war movement, the civil rights movement, and the feminist movement. 

  

Modern Marxism is a complex and diverse body of thought, but it is united by a common commitment to understanding and changing the world. Modern Marxists believe that capitalism is a

Model Output: [multimodal]SOUTH CHINA SEA - The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Benfold (DDG 65) conducted a freedom of navigation operation (FONOP) past the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea July 13. 

  

International law allows U.S. and other vessels to navigate in the Paracel Islands or other parts of the South China Sea without requesting permission from any of the claimants. China, however, claims almost the entire South China Sea as its territory and routinely issues excessive maritime claims and engages in dangerous behavior against other nations operating in the region. 

  

<start_of_image> in the interest of preserving access to the global commons, Benfold conducted this FONOP in accordance with international law. FONOPs are not about one country, they are about the right of every country to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows. 

  

“By conducting routine and regular FONOPs, the United States demonstrates that we will fly, sail, and operate anywhere international law allows, and that we reject any nation’s unlawful attempts to restrict these freedoms,” said Capt. Carlos Sardiello, Benfold’s commanding officer. “The United States is committed to upholding the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea. We will continue to fly, sail, and operate anywhere international law allows while challenging excessive maritime claims.” 

  

The United States is a Pacific power and will continue to operate in the Indo-Pacific region. U.S. forces will continue to fly, sail, and operate anywhere international law allows and will continue to challenge excessive maritime claims that could impede legitimate uses of the sea. 

  

<start_of_image> in accordance with international law, the United States and our allies and partners will continue to operate in the South China Sea as we have for many years. “We do this not to increase tensions, but to maintain stability,” said Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III. “We all benefit from a free and open Indo-Pacific. That’s why we continue to work with allies and partners in the region to strengthen a rules-based international order.” 

  

Benfold is assigned to Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 15 and is part of Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 11, led by USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72). CSG 11 is on a scheduled deployment in the U.S. 7th Fleet area of operations to enhance interoperability through alliances and partnerships while serving as a ready-response force in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region. 

  

As the U.S. Navy's forward-deployed destroyer in Southeast Asia, DESRON 15 serves as U.S. 7th Fleet's principal surface force and provides a ready defense for U.S., allied and partner interests in the Indo-Pacific region. DESRON 15 also supports the P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft based in Kadena Air Base, Japan, engaging in long-range maritime patrol and reconnaissance operations. 

  

<start_of_image> from U.S. Indo-Pacific Command Public Affairs  

  

<start_of_image>Unnecessary and provocative. The U.S.warship's move is a blatant violation of international law and the basic norms of international relations. It has severely undermined regional peace and stability, and infringed upon China's sovereignty and security interests. China strongly deplores and firmly opposes it. 

  

The Paracel Islands are an integral part of China's territory. China has indisputable sovereignty over the Paracel Islands and their adjacent waters. The Chinese government has been exercising effective administration over the Paracel Islands since ancient times. 

  

In May 2016, an arbitral tribunal constituted under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) illegally and invalidly delivered an award regarding the South China Sea arbitration initiated by the previous Philippine government. The award is null and void, and has no legal binding force for China. China neither accepts nor recognizes it. 

  

The U.S. government repeatedly stated that it takes no position on the territorial sovereignty over the South China Sea islands. However, it sent warships to trespass into the waters adjacent to Chinese islands and reefs with the excuse of freedom of navigation, to flex muscles, stir up troubles and escalate tensions in the region. 

  

The U.S. claims to be committed to maintaining stability in the South China Sea. However, its provocative moves to violate China's territorial sovereignty and security interests are playing a negative role on regional peace and stability. The U.S. attempts to sow discord among regional countries will not succeed. 

  

China urges the U.S. side to immediately stop such irresponsible and dangerous provocations, strictly abide by international law and basic norms of international relations, respect China's territorial sovereignty and security interests, and avoid any actions that may harm regional peace and stability. 

  

China will continue taking necessary measures to safeguard its national sovereignty and security interests, and to uphold regional peace and stability. 

  

<start_of_image>4) U.S. Defense Department: 

  

The United States conducted a freedom of navigation operation (FONOP) in the South China Sea on July 13, 2022, consistent with international law. The FONOP was conducted in accordance with the Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the United States’ navigational rights and freedoms in the South China Sea. 

  

The United States’ interest in the South China Sea is rooted in maintaining peace and stability, upholding the freedom of navigation and overflight, and respecting the rights and freedoms of all states under international law. The United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate anywhere international law allows while challenging excessive maritime claims and defending our national interests. 

  

The United States’ FONOPs are not about one country, they are about the right of every country to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows. The United States will continue to uphold the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea. 

  

The United States is a Pacific power and will continue to operate in the Indo-Pacific region. U.S. forces will continue to fly, sail, and operate anywhere international law allows and will continue to challenge excessive maritime claims that could impede legitimate uses of the sea. 

  

in accordance with international law, the United States and our allies and partners will continue to operate in the South China Sea as we have for many years. “We do this not to increase tensions, but to maintain stability,” said Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III. “We all benefit from a free and open Indo-Pacific. That’s why we continue to work with allies and partners in the region to strengthen a rules-based international order.” 

  

<start_of_image>JPC: Why can't we get along? Why have China and the United States been playing the blame game, when we should be working together to address global issues like climate change? 

  

L: Actually, China and the United States have been cooperating on climate change. It's just that other issues, such as the Taiwan issue and the trade war, have soured the relationship between the two countries. In fact, China and the United States are the world's two largest greenhouse gas emitters, and they have a responsibility to work together to address climate change. In 2014, the two countries signed a joint agreement to cooperate on climate change, and they have been working together since then to reduce emissions. However, the Trump administration pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, which was a major setback for international cooperation on climate change. The Biden administration has since rejoined the Paris Agreement, and China and the United States have resumed their cooperation on climate change. However, the two countries still have different views on some aspects of climate change, such as the level of emissions reductions that are necessary. 

  

JPC: So, there's still hope that the two countries can work together on climate change? 

  

L: Yes, there is hope. China and the United States are both major powers with a responsibility to address climate change. They have a track record of cooperation on climate change, and they have both expressed a willingness to work together on this issue. However, it will take a lot of effort and cooperation from both sides to overcome the challenges and build a sustainable relationship. 

  

JPC: What are some other global issues that China and the United States could work together to address? 

  

L: There are a number of other global issues that China and the United States could work together to address, including: 

  

* The COVID-19 pandemic: China and the United States are both major players in the global economy, and they have a responsibility to work together to address the economic and health impacts of the pandemic. 

* Nuclear proliferation: China and the United States are both nuclear powers, and they have a responsibility to work together to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote nuclear disarmament. 

* Terrorism: China and the United States are both targets of terrorism, and they have a responsibility to work together to combat terrorism and promote peace and stability in the world. 

* Global poverty: China and the United States are both major economies, and they have a responsibility to work together to address global poverty and promote economic development. 

* Climate change: As we discussed earlier, China and the United States are both major greenhouse gas emitters, and they have a responsibility to work together to address climate change. 

  

These are just a few of the global issues that China and the United States could work together to address. By working together, the two countries can make a significant contribution to global peace and prosperity. 

  

JPC: Thank you for your time, Professor Li. 

  

L: You're welcome. I hope this helps.

Model Output: It's time to change the way we think about organizations. 

  

In Instead of Slavery, women's rights activist, organizational consultant, and founder of Prospera Sheila B. Kamerman challenges conventional wisdom about the best way to structure organizations. Rooted in her work with Prospera, a multinational network of women's collectives, Kamerman proposes a new organizational model that not only rejects the hierarchical and patriarchal structures of traditional organizations but also challenges the assumptions we make about the relationship between self and society, work and family, and leader and follower.  

  

Instead of Slavery offers a radical alternative to career slavery; the oppression and exploitation of workers; and the economic and social injustices of the globalized economy. Kamerman lays out the structural problems of capitalism as we know it and links these dynamics to the oppression of women, the destruction of the environment, the decline of democracy, and the rise of fascism. Through inspiring and instructive case studies, she shows how Prospera's model has worked--and can work again--to change structures and create new possibilities for meaningful work, ownership, and satisfying and fulfilling lives.  

  

Kamerman's call for a worker-owned economy and transformative education gives readers a roadmap to an alternative future--a world where organizations serve people, not the other way around. Instead of Slavery is a bold and timely manifesto that charts a course for a more just and democratic society.

A TikToker has settled the debate as to why British people use the word "Cheers" instead of "Thank you". 

  

Explaining the origins of the informal expression, the TikTok account British Memes posted a video using clips from the 1990s sitcom Father Ted. 

  

In one clip, Father Ted's housekeeper Mrs. Doyle says "Thank you for that, Father" and proceeds to clink glasses with him. 

  

While in the second clip as she serves him tea, Father Ted tells her "Thank you, Mrs. Doyle" and she replies with "No bother, Father" as she raises her glass to him. 

  

The video explains "She says 'cheers' after 'thank you' because 'cheers' means 'thank you' and 'you're welcome'." 

  

The clip has been viewed over 500,000 times, with many non-British people sharing their surprise at the explanation. 

  

One TikTok user said "I'm going to be using this constantly," while another added "I love cheers now." 

  

While others have shared their own experiences of using the word "Cheers" incorrectly, one person said "My English teacher in HS used to say 'Cheers, mate' a lot, as a native Spanish speaker I thought he was always proposing a toast." 

  

Another person wrote "I thought it was 'Cheers to you!' for the longest time." 

  

Well, it's all cleared up now!

Model Output: Feb. 19 marked the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty that set binding obligations on industrialized countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The treaty was adopted on 11 December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan and entered into force on 16 February 2005. As of February 2016, 192 states have ratified the treaty. 

  

The Kyoto Protocol is an important milestone in the global effort to combat climate change. It was the first international agreement to set legally binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The treaty has helped to raise awareness of the dangers of climate change and has encouraged countries to take action to reduce their emissions. 

  

However, the Kyoto Protocol has also been criticized for its limited scope and its failure to include major emitters such as the United States, China, and India. In addition, the treaty has been difficult to enforce, and many countries have failed to meet their emissions targets. 

  

Despite its limitations, the Kyoto Protocol has played an important role in the global effort to combat climate change. The treaty has helped to raise awareness of the dangers of climate change and has encouraged countries to take action to reduce their emissions. The treaty has also provided a framework for future international agreements on climate change. 

  

In 2015, the Paris Agreement was adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris, France. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. The goal of the agreement is to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this goal, countries have agreed to submit national climate action plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), that outline their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

  

The Paris Agreement is a significant step forward in the global effort to combat climate change. The agreement is more ambitious than the Kyoto Protocol and includes all major emitters, including the United States, China, and India. The agreement also provides a framework for future international cooperation on climate change. 

  

The Paris Agreement is a promising development in the global effort to combat climate change. However, there is still much work to be done. Countries need to implement their NDCs and reduce their emissions. In addition, developed countries need to provide financial and technological support to developing countries to help them transition to low-carbon economies. 

  

The 15th anniversary of the Kyoto Protocol is an opportunity to reflect on the progress that has been made in the global effort to combat climate change. It is also an opportunity to renew our commitment to taking action to address this global challenge.

Model Output: Australia does not have a president. It is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government, and the head of state is the British monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II. The Queen is represented in Australia by the Governor-General, who is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Australian Prime Minister. The current Governor-General is David Hurley. 

  

The head of government in Australia is the Prime Minister, who is the leader of the party or coalition that has the majority of seats in the House of Representatives. The Prime Minister is appointed by the Governor-General. The current Prime Minister is Anthony Albanese. 

Model Output: Anthony Albanese is an Australian politician serving as the 31st and current prime minister of Australia and leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) since 2019. He has been the member of parliament (MP) for Grayndler since 1996. 

  

Albanese was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and grew up in public housing in Camperdown. He attended St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill, and the University of Sydney, where he studied economics and law. After graduating, he worked as a research officer for the Labor Council of New South Wales and as a policy adviser to state and federal Labor politicians. 

  

Albanese was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1996 federal election, representing the electorate of Grayndler in inner-western Sydney. He was appointed to the Shadow Ministry in 2001 and served in various portfolios, including transport, ageing, and infrastructure. In 2007, he was elected deputy leader of the ALP under Kevin Rudd. 

  

When Rudd resigned as prime minister in 2010, Albanese contested the leadership ballot but was defeated by Julia Gillard. He served as deputy prime minister and minister for infrastructure and transport in Gillard's government until she was deposed by Rudd in 2013. Albanese challenged Rudd for the leadership in 2013 but was again defeated. 

  

After Labor's defeat at the 2013 federal election, Albanese was elected unopposed as leader of the ALP. He led the party to defeat at the 2016 federal election but retained his seat in Grayndler. At the 2019 federal election, Labor won a surprise victory, and Albanese became prime minister. 

  

As prime minister, Albanese has focused on addressing climate change, improving relations with Australia's Pacific neighbors, and strengthening the economy. He has also committed to increasing Australia's defense spending in response to the rising threat from China. 

  

Albanese is married to Jodie Haydon, a former deputy premier of New South Wales. They have one son together.

<start_of_image> in Louisiana, 3 cases out of 100 come from feds 

  

The U.S. Justice Department and federal agencies are increasingly filing lawsuits in federal court in Louisiana, putting an extraordinary burden on the judiciary and on taxpayers, Louisiana Attorney General Caldwell Cazayoux said in a letter last week to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. 

  

According to Cazayoux, in 2015 the Justice Department filed 101 civil cases in the state's Western District, more than triple the 32 filed in 2010. Because the Justice Department has much larger resources than defendants, he said, many decide to settle sooner rather than fight, even if they have a strong case. 

  

"Many Louisiana citizens feel intimidated by the federal government when sued in federal court," Cazayoux wrote. "Intimidation may cause some to settle cases against them that they should win. Or, if they cannot afford to hire an attorney, they may not be represented at all." 

  

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

  

Cazayoux said 30 percent of the cases in the Western District come from the federal government, compared with just 4 percent in the populous Eastern District of Louisiana. 

  

He said most of the federal cases settle without a judgment, so the courts receive no final decisions about the law or guidance on what to do in similar cases in the future. 

  

"The high number of U.S. Justice Department filings," Cazayoux said, "is clogging our federal court dockets, taking away its precious time and resources that could be used to help citizens resolve disputes between themselves." 

  

The state's federal judges, he said, "have been forced to reallocate their time, including delaying resolution of criminal cases, to address the large influx of civil cases." 

  

The federal courts have taken steps to reduce the backlog of cases. Earlier this month, Chief Judge Dee Drell of the U.S. Western District Court of Louisiana announced that the court has created a special docket for employment cases. 

  

Drell said the court is receiving so many employment cases that they are clogging the fast-track docket that is used for civil cases that are expected to last less than a year. 

  

She said the creation of the special docket will help the court manage and streamline the employment cases, as well as the fast-track docket. 

  

Drell said the court also is forming a committee of lawyers to make recommendations for additional ways to improve the management of employment cases. 

  

The court has a total of 201 cases pending in the employment docket and 139 pending in the fast-track docket, Drell said.
