Enter user input: This investigation demonstrates that GitHub Copilot can quote
a body of code verbatim, yet it rarely does so, and when it does, it mostly quot
es code that everybody quotes, typically at the beginning of a file, as if to br
eak the ice. However, there’s still one big difference between GitHub Copilot re
citing code and me reciting a poem: I know when I’m quoting. I would also like t
o know when Copilot is echoing existing code rather than coming up with its own
ideas. That way, I’m able to look up background information about that code, and
 when to include credit where credit is due. The answer is obvious: sharing the
prefiltering solution we used in this analysis to detect overlap with the traini
ng set. When a suggestion contains snippets copied from the training set, the UI
 should simply tell you where it’s quoted from. You can then either include prop
er attribution, or decide against using that code altogether. This duplication s
earch is not yet integrated into the technical preview, but we plan to do so. We
 will both continue to work on decreasing rates of recitation, as well as making
 its detection more precise.

<h1>What if the untied states of America suddenly became a anarchy?</h1>

[Answer 1]

The US would collapse and split into smaller entities, where the strongest will
survive and the rest will have to bow to the strongest, or die.

[Answer 2]

One of the main reasons why a large democracy such as the United States tends to
 function is that it’s composed of smaller, self-governing communities, such as
states and counties and towns etc.

These self-governing communities are able to enact laws and regulations that are
 specifically tailored to their own unique needs and circumstances, while still
being part of a larger, more unified whole.

This system of federalism allows for a great deal of local autonomy and self-det
ermination, while still providing the benefits of a larger, more powerful nation
.

In the event of a sudden collapse of the federal government, these smaller, self
-governing communities would still exist and would still be able to function, al
beit with some difficulty.

In the short term, there would likely be a great deal of chaos and uncertainty,
as people struggled to adjust to the new reality of living in an anarchy.

However, over time, it’s likely that new forms of government would emerge, at th
e local and regional level.

These new governments would likely be more decentralized and more responsive to
the needs of the people they serve, than the federal government ever was.

In the long term, it’s possible that the United States could actually become a m
ore democratic and more just society, if it were to break up into smaller, more
self-governing communities.

[Answer 3]

There would be a short period of chaos and uncertainty as people tried to figure
 out what to do.

There would be a power vacuum that would likely be filled by various groups, inc
luding armed militias, criminal gangs, and religious cults.

There would be a breakdown of law and order, leading to increased crime and viol
ence.

The economy would collapse as businesses closed and people lost their jobs.

There would be a humanitarian crisis as people struggled to find food, water, an
d shelter.

Eventually, some form of order would be restored, but it would likely be a very
different world than the one we know today.

[Answer 4]

If the United States of America were to suddenly become an anarchy, it would lik
ely spell major disruption and significant consequences for the nation and its i
nhabitants. The effects would be multi-faceted and vary depending on the geograp
hical regions, societal structures, and individual responses to the ensuing chao
s. Some of the key implications of such a transformation include:

1. Dissolution of Governmental Authority:
The sudden collapse of the federal and state governments would lead to a power v
acuum. Local authorities might struggle to maintain order, resulting in widespre
ad lawlessness and a lack of public services.

2. Public Safety and Security:
In the absence of a functioning legal system, the safety and security of citizen
s would be compromised. Crime, violence, and social unrest would likely escalate
 as individuals and groups sought to protect their interests through force.

3. Economic and Financial Collapse:
The existing economic system would likely collapse, leading to the failure of bu
sinesses, widespread unemployment, and a scarcity of essential goods and service
s. Without regulated trade, commerce, and financial institutions, the economy wo
uld face severe instability.

4. Infrastructure Breakdown:
The lack of government oversight and coordination would result in the deteriorat
ion of essential infrastructure, including transportation, energy, water systems
, and communication networks. Access to vital utilities would become limited, im
pacting the overall quality of life.

5. Social Disintegration:
Anarchy might lead to a breakdown of social bonds, amplifying mistrust and divis
ion among individuals and communities. The absence of societal norms and values
could exacerbate existing societal problems.

6. Regional Power Dynamics:
Different regions of the country might react differently to the collapse of cent
ral authority. Some areas could descend into chaos, while others might establish
 local alliances or autonomous communities. Regional disparities and conflicts c
ould arise.

7. Humanitarian Crisis:
The sudden disruption of supply chains, combined with the breakdown of law and o
rder, could lead to a severe humanitarian crisis. Food shortages, lack of access
 to medical care, and deteriorating living conditions would pose significant thr
eats to the well-being of the population.

8. International Relations:
The collapse of the United States as a world power would have profound implicati
ons for global politics. Other nations might seize the opportunity to assert the
ir influence, leading to geopolitical shifts and potential conflicts.

9. New Forms of Governance:
In time, new forms of governance might emerge at the local or regional level. Th
ese structures could range from temporary alliances to more permanent forms of s
elf-rule, shaped by the unique circumstances and values of each community.

The specific consequences of anarchy in the United States would depend on numero
us factors, including the manner in which the government collapsed, the reaction
s of military and law enforcement entities, the extent of public cooperation, an
d the global response. The ultimate outcome would be contingent upon the resilie
nce and resourcefulness of the American people in navigating a profoundly altere
d reality.

[Answer 5]

There would be widespread chaos and violence. The government would cease to func
tion, and the military would likely disband. Without a central authority to main
tain order, there would be a breakdown of law and order. People would be forced
to fend for themselves, and there would be a rise in crime and violence.

The economy would collapse, as businesses would close and people would lose thei
r jobs. There would be a shortage of food and other essential supplies, and peop
le would struggle to survive.

In the long term, it is possible that a new government would eventually emerge,
but it is also possible that the United States would be permanently divided into
 smaller, independent states.

[Answer 6]

It would be a very bad thing, because people would be free to do whatever they w
anted. There would be no laws to protect people from each other, so there would
be a lot of crime and violence.

[Answer 7]

It would be a nightmare. There would be no law and order, and people would be fr
ee to do whatever they wanted. There would be a lot of crime and violence, and p
eople would be living in fear.

The economy would collapse, because businesses would be unable to operate in an
anarchic environment. There would be no jobs, and people would be starving.

The government would cease to exist, and there would be no one to protect the pe
ople. The country would fall into chaos, and it would be a very dark time.

[Answer 8]

It would be chaos.

Businesses would close, there would be no law enforcement, and people would be f
ree to do whatever they wanted.

There would be widespread looting and violence.

Eventually, some form of order would be restored, but it would be a very differe
nt world than the one we know today.

[Answer 9]

If the United States suddenly became an anarchy, it would likely result in wides
pread chaos and violence. Without a central government to maintain order, people
 would be free to do whatever they wanted, which would likely lead to a breakdow
n of law and order. There would be a rise in crime and violence, and people woul
d be living in constant fear for their lives and property.

The economy would also collapse, as businesses would be unable to operate in an
anarchic environment. There would be no jobs, and people would be struggling to
find food and shelter.

Eventually, some form of order would likely be restored, but it would be a very
different world than the one we know today. It is possible that the United State
s would be divided into smaller, independent states, each with its own laws and
government. It is also possible that a new, more authoritarian government would
emerge, which would impose its will on the people.

Whatever happens, it is clear that an anarchy in the United States would be a ve
ry bad thing. It would lead to widespread suffering and death, and it would be a
 setback for democracy and human rights around the world.

[Answer 10]

There is no one answer to this question as the effects would vary depending on t
he specific circumstances. However, some general consequences could include:

* A breakdown of law and order, leading to an increase in crime and violence.
* The collapse of the economy, as businesses and trade would be disrupted.
* A humanitarian crisis, as people would struggle to access food, water, and she
lter.
* The rise of armed groups and militias, as people seek to protect themselves an
d their property.
* The disintegration of the United States as a unified nation, as states and reg
ions would likely begin to assert their independence.
* A power vacuum that could be filled by foreign powers, leading to increased in
ternational instability.

This is just a general overview of some of the potential consequences of anarchy
 in the United States. The specific effects would depend on a variety of factors
, including the circumstances that led to the collapse of the government, the re
sponse of the military and law enforcement, and the actions of individual citize
ns and groups.

collapse of the federal and state governments would lead to a power v acuum. Local authori

public services. 2. Public Safety and Security: In the absence of a functioning legal syst

 unrest would likely escalate  as individuals and groups sought to protect their interests
 through force. 3. Economic and Financial Collapse: The existing economic system would lik

 mistrust and divis ion among individuals and communities. The absence of societal norms a

 composed of smaller, self-governing communities, such as states and counties and towns et

fically tailored to their own unique needs and circumstances, while still being part of a
larger, more unified whole. This system of federalism allows for a great deal of local aut
onomy and self-det ermination, while still providing the benefits of a larger, more powerf
ul nation . In the event of a sudden collapse of the federal government, these smaller, se
lf -governing communities would still exist and would still be able to function, al beit w

certainty, as people struggled to adjust to the new reality of living in an anarchy. Howev
er, over time, it’s likely that new forms of government would emerge, at th e local and re

 to the needs of the people they serve, than the federal government ever was. In the long

 The effects would be multi-faceted and vary depending on the geograp hical regions, socie
tal structures, and individual responses to the ensuing chao s. Some of the key implicatio
ns of such a transformation include: 1. Dissolution of Governmental Authority: The sudden
collapse of the federal and state governments would lead to a power v acuum. Local authori
ties might struggle to maintain order, resulting in widespre ad lawlessness and a lack of
public services. 2. Public Safety and Security: In the absence of a functioning legal syst
em, the safety and security of citizen s would be compromised. Crime, violence, and social
 unrest would likely escalate  as individuals and groups sought to protect their interests
 through force. 3. Economic and Financial Collapse: The existing economic system would lik
ely collapse, leading to the failure of bu sinesses, widespread unemployment, and a scarci
ty of essential goods and service s. Without regulated trade, commerce, and financial inst
itutions, the economy wo uld face severe instability. 4. Infrastructure Breakdown: The lac

 infrastructure, including transportation, energy, water systems , and communication netwo

 mistrust and divis ion among individuals and communities. The absence of societal norms a

ome areas could descend into chaos, while others might establish  local alliances or auton
omous communities. Regional disparities and conflicts c ould arise. 7. Humanitarian Crisis
: The sudden disruption of supply chains, combined with the breakdown of law and o rder, c
ould lead to a severe humanitarian crisis. Food shortages, lack of access  to medical care
, and deteriorating living conditions would pose significant thr eats to the well-being of
 the population. 8. International Relations: The collapse of the United States as a world
power would have profound implicati ons for global politics. Other nations might seize the
 opportunity to assert the ir influence, leading to geopolitical shifts and potential conf
licts. 9. New Forms of Governance: In time, new forms of governance might emerge at the lo
cal or regional level. Th ese structures could range from temporary alliances to more perm

. The specific consequences of anarchy in the United States would depend on numero us fact

Во الوقت الذي أصبح فيه العالم متصلاً من خلال تكنولوجيا المعلومات، لايزال بعض الناس غريبين
عن هذا الموضوع. ومن هؤلاء الفنان والمنتج الهولندي كلاس أولدنبورغ المنتمي لجيل الستينيات، ا
لذي بدأ مؤخراً بتجربة أسلوب جديد في الفن مستخدماً أجهزة المحمول، والهاتف الارضي، والفاكس،
والإنترنت في تنفيذ أعماله الفنية.

وحتى وقت قريب، كان أولدنبورغ الذي عمل في مجال فن تقنيات البوب والأحداث يرى أن الاستخدام ال
متزايد لتكنولوجيا المعلومات يؤدي إلى ضعف روابط العلاقات بين الناس.

وقال أولدنبورغ في مقابلة: "على الرغم من أن ثورة المعلومات والتواصل التي يشهدها العالم ما ه
ي إلا ثورة في حد ذاتها، إلا أن الناس باتوا أكثر عزلة" إلا أن الفنان الهولندي أدرك بعد ذلك
أن تكنولوجيا المعلومات لديها قدرة هائلة على التقريب بين الناس.

وقال أولدنبورغ (80 عاماً)، الذي يرجع تاريخه الفني إلى عام 1960، في معرض أقيم في معهد "وايت
ه تشابل" للفنون في لندن بعنوان "بين السطرين": "يجب الاعتراف بأن السرعة التي تتغير بها تكنو
لوجيا المعلومات تؤدي إلى تغير جذري في العلاقات بين الناس وبينهم والعالم".

وأضاف أولدنبورغ: "لا يزال هذا أمراً جديداً للغاية. وعلينا الانتظار حتى تصبح هذه التكنولوجي
ا جزءاً من حياتنا اليومية".

ويُنظر إلى أولدنبورغ على أنه من مؤسسي فن البوب، إلى جانب الفنان الأمريكي، روي ليختنشتاين،
والانجليزي، بيتر بليك.

ويقول أولدنبورغ، الذي تتميز أعماله الحجم الهائل، وبالروح الدعابة في معظم الأحيان، إنه لطال
ما حاول تجاوز الحدود الفنية المقبولة "حتى لو أدى ذلك إلى فقدان فكرة الفن بالكامل".

وقد أثار أولدنبورغ الجدل في عام 1961 من خلال إنشاء نسخ ثلاثية الأبعاد من الأشياء العادية ا
لتي تُباع في محلات البقالة، مثل الأطعمة المعلبة واللحوم.

وفي وقت لاحق، بدأ أولدنبورغ في استخدام الهواتف الأرضية، والفاكس، وأجهزة المحمول، والإنترنت
 لإنشاء فن فكاهي.

ويقول أولدنبورغ إن الهواتف المحمولة بوجه خاص لها صلة قوية بمختلف أنحاء العالم. وقال الفنان
 الهولندي: "تستطيع اليوم أن تجري مكالمة هاتفية مع أي شخص في العالم. ويمكنك التصفح بين صور
وأدلة وإجراء مقابلات مع أي شخص في العالم دون مغادرة غرفتك. وهذا في غاية الروعة".

ويقول أولدنبورغ إنه استخدم الفاكس لإنشاء المزيد من الأعمال الفنية الجادة، مثل إرسال رسائل
سلبية ودعائية إلى البيت الأبيض خلال فترة حكم الرئيس الأمريكي، رونالد ريغان، في ثمانينات ال
قرن الماضي.

واستخدم أولدنبورغ الإنترنت أيضاً لإنتاج أعمال فنية كالبريد الإلكتروني.

ويعتزم أولدنبورغ الاستمرار في استخدام تكنولوجيا المعلومات في المستقبل، متوقعًا أن تتغير هذ
ه التكنولوجيا بشكل جذري في السنوات القادمة.

وقال أولدنبورغ: "أتمنى أن تستمر هذه الثورات، وأن تفتح الباب أمامنا للوصول إلى أشكال جديدة
من السلطة". "وعندما يحس المرء أنه قادر على التحكم في شكل السلطة الذي يريد أن يستخدمه، فإن
هذا الشعور يكون في غاية الروعة".

<p id="0" uid0">I'm a beginner. Do you have any general advice as someone just starting ou
t?

I'm new to drawing and I would love to improve my skills. I've been practicing for a few w
eeks now but I'm not seeing much improvement. Do you have any general advice for me as som
eone just starting out?</p>

<blockquote id="1" pid="0" uid="1">1. **Start with the basics**: Learn about the fundament
als of drawing, including perspective, proportion, anatomy, and lighting. There are many o
nline tutorials and books that can teach you these basics.

2. **Practice regularly**: The best way to improve your drawing skills is to practice regu
larly. Try to set aside some time each day, even if it's just for a few minutes.

3. **Draw from reference**: Don't just draw from your imagination. Use reference photos or
 objects to help you create more accurate and realistic drawings.

4. **Experiment with different mediums**: Try out different drawing mediums, such as penci
ls, charcoal, ink, and paint. Each medium has its own unique properties and can be used to
 create different effects.

5. **Don't be afraid to make mistakes**: Everyone makes mistakes when they're learning to
draw. The important thing is to learn from your mistakes and keep practicing.

6. **Feedback**: One of the best ways to improve your drawing skills is to get continuous
feedback from fellow artists or instructors. Take some of your drawings to art teachers or
 experienced artists for a critique. It can help you identify your strengths and weaknesse
s.

7. **Use tutorials and other resources**: Do not feel ashamed of using tutorials and video
s to learn. These can provide indispensable guidance and insights, especially when you are
 starting.

8. **Explore different styles**: Experiment with different styles to find one that fits yo
u. There's no one right way to draw. Try out different techniques and materials to see wha
t works best for you.

9. **Draw what you love**: Choose subjects that you're passionate about. This will make th
e drawing process more enjoyable and help you stay motivated.

10. **Be patient**: Drawing takes time and practice. Don't get discouraged if you don't se
e immediate results. Just keep practicing and you will eventually see improvement.</blockq
uote>

<blockquote id="2" pid="0" uid="2">keep drawing :)

pick a thing, and draw it over and over until you're happy with how it looks. then pick an
other thing and do the same. eventually you'll be able to draw whatever you want.

your drawings don't have to be perfect. just keep practicing and you'll see improvement ov
er time.</blockquote>

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee’s 19-point win over Missouri on Tuesday night served as a mic
rocosm for the season — a game that promised to be competitive quickly spiraled out of con
trol.

The Volunteers (15-6, 6-2 SEC) absolutely annihilated the Tigers (10-11, 1-7) at Thompson-
Boling Arena, taking a 21-point lead with 4:25 left in the first half and cruising to a 73
-54 victory.

Tennessee coach Cuonzo Martin said his team beat Missouri “in every facet of the game.”

“We beat them on the glass, we beat them defensively,” said Martin, whose team outrebounde
d Missouri 45-29. “We were more physical. I thought we moved the ball very well offensivel
y. Our bench came in and gave us a big lift.”

Tennessee was led by junior guard Chris Lofton, who scored 21 points on 7-of-13 shooting a
nd was 3-of-6 from 3-point range. He scored 13 of his points in the first half as Tennesse
e quickly built an insurmountable lead.

Sophomore forward Tyler Smith added 13 points, including a pair of 3-pointers, and senior
point guard Ramar Smith had 11 points. Wayne Chism and Bobby Maze tied for the team lead w
ith eight rebounds apiece.

“I thought we played with a lot of energy,” said Lofton, who entered the game leading the
SEC in scoring. “We were very active on defense. We were able to force some turnovers, get
 some steals, and create some transition baskets. That really got us going.”

Missouri was led by sophomore guard Zaire Taylor, who scored 15 points. Junior forward DeM
arre Carroll added 11 points, and senior guard Stefhon Hannah had 10 points.

Missouri coach Mike Anderson said his team was overwhelmed by Tennessee’s athleticism.

“They came out with a game plan, and they executed their game plan to perfection,” Anderso
n said. “We kind of panicked offensively, and that led to some bad shots and some turnover
s.

“They pressured us, and we didn’t handle the pressure very well.”

Tennessee limited Missouri leading scorer Leo Lyons to three points on 0-for-9 shooting. T
he 6-foot-5 junior entered the game averaging 18.5 points per game.

“It’s always a great feeling when you’re able to stop a guy like that,” Tyler Smith said o
f Lyons. “Leo Lyons is a great player. He’s had a great season. For us to be able to go ou
t there and hold him to three points was a great accomplishment.”

The Volunteers hit 7-of-17 3-pointers (41.2 percent) and shot 46.7 percent from the field
overall. Missouri hit only 2-of-13 3-pointers (15.4 percent) and shot 33.8 percent overall
.

The Tigers committed 18 turnovers, which Tennessee converted into 22 points. The Volunteer
s committed only seven turnovers.

The loss was Missouri’s seventh consecutive and dropped the Tigers into last place in the
SEC East standings.

“We’ve got to grow up quick,” Anderson said. “When you have young guys, and they’re not pl
aying well, you have to be patient. But patience is something you don’t have a lot of in t
he Southeastern Conference.”

Tennessee, meanwhile, remained in second place in the SEC East standings, one-half game be
hind leader Florida.

“We’ve got a tough schedule coming up,” Martin said. “But we’re not going to worry about t
hat now. We’re just going to enjoy this one tonight.”
